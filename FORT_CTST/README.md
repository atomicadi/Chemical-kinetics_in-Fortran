The theory of reaction rates that was published almost simultaneously by Henry Eyring, and by M. G. Evans and M. Polanyi in 1935 is referred to now as conventional transtition-state theory (CTST). This theory involves the same assumptions and approximations that are made in the calculations of equilibrium constants using statistical mechanics.\
So after margeing the statistical mechanics and chemical equilibrium and to calculate the CTST rate constant, the partition functin of both the reactants and activated complex is needed. The total partition function of a molecule can be written as:

q = \sum_i g_i e^{-\frac{Îµ_i}{k_BT}} ...... (1)
